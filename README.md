> **100 Days. No Cap.**

This is a public proof-of-work run.

No excuses.  
No perfection.  
No talking without shipping.

## 🧠 The Mission

I show up.  
I code.  
I push.

That’s it.

Some days are clean.  
Some days are messy.  
Some days are small wins.  
Some days are straight grind.

But the chain doesn’t break.

## 🧩 What Does This Represents

Consistency over comfort.  
Execution over ideas.  
Proof over promises.

Not here to impress.  
Here to **put the work on record**.

## 🕶️ dev in a bandana

Anonymous by choice.  
Focused by habit.  
Building in public.

No flex.  
No filters.  
Just commits.

## 🏁 Final Word

This is not motivation content.  
This is not a tutorial repo.

This is a **streak**.

If you’re here early, you’ll see the growth.  
If you’re here later, you’ll see the receipts.

Day by day.  
Brick by brick.

See you on the graph.
